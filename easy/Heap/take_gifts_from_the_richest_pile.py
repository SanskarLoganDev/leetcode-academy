# Solved

# Companies
# Hint
# You are given an integer array gifts denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:

# Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
# If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
# Reduce the number of gifts in the pile to the floor of the square root of the original number of gifts in the pile.
# Return the number of gifts remaining after k seconds.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4
# Output: 29
# Explanation: 
# The gifts are taken in the following way:
# - In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.
# - Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.
# - After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.
# - Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.
# The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.
# Example 2:

# Input: gifts = [1,1,1,1], k = 4
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 
# In this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile. 
# That is, you can't take any pile with you. 
# So, the total gifts remaining are 4.
