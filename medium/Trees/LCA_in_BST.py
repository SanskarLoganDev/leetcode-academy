# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
# Neetcode 150 (Important)

# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

# Example 1:

# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

# Example 2:

# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

# Example 3:

# Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
# Output: 2
 
# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
# -109 <= Node.val <= 109
# All Node.val are unique.
# p != q
# p and q will exist in the BST.

# Same solution as LCA of binary tree will also apply here

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

# time complexity: O(logN) where N is the number of nodes in the tree
# space complexity: O(1) where H is the height of the tree

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root:
            return None
        if root==p or root==q:
            return root
        if p.val<root.val and q.val<root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        if p.val>root.val and q.val>root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        return root # this happens when p and q are on opposite ends of root
