# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
# Neetcode 150 (Important)

# Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree. 

# Example 1:
# https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree1.jpg
# Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
# Output: 1

# Example 2:
# https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree2.jpg
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
# Output: 3
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is n.
# 1 <= k <= n <= 104
# 0 <= Node.val <= 104
 

# Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
